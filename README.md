# 🏥 Hospital Management System

A full-stack Java-based web application developed as a university group project. The system streamlines hospital operations such as patient management, staff management, appointment scheduling, and payment processing. Built using Servlet technology and MVC architecture, this project demonstrates effective use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in a real-world healthcare scenario.

## 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts Used

| OOP Concept     | Where It's Used                           | Purpose                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | In model classes like `Patient`, `Doctor`  | Keeps class variables private with public getters/setters |
| **Abstraction**   | Utility/helper methods                    | Hides implementation details from main program flow       |
| **Inheritance**   | If used across common base classes        | Reuses code for shared functionality                     |
| **Polymorphism**  | Overriding methods in different classes   | Handles common behavior in multiple object types         |

## 👨‍💻 My Role in the Project

As part of the team, I was responsible for implementing the **Patient Management Module**, which includes:

- Adding new patient records
- Viewing and searching patient data
- Updating patient information
- Deleting records
- Ensuring data is saved and loaded via Java file I/O

This required designing patient-related classes, managing data validation, and integrating file operations for real-time updates.
